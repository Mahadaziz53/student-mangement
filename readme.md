## Overview

I created this project to work on a dataset from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to analyze the data and find useful insights. The dataset has information about education and applications, but it needs some cleaning because the data is messy.

## Why I Made This Project

1. To practice working with real-world data.
2. To improve my skills in cleaning and organizing data.
3. To find patterns and insights that can be useful.

## About the Dataset

**Source**:[Kaggle]
**What It Contains**: Details about education, application modes, and courses. **Problem**: The data is not in a proper format, so I need to clean it before using it.

## What I Did in This Project

1. **Load the Data**: I imported the dataset into Python.
2. **Clean the Data**: I fixed the messy data and organized it into proper columns.
3. **Analyze the Data**: I looked for patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Visualize the Data**: I created graphs and charts to make the data easier to understand.

## How This Project Works

1. The dataset is loaded into a Python program.
2. The data is cleaned to fix errors and formatting issues.
3. After cleaning, I analyzed the data and showed important results.

## Next Steps

- Clean the data further to make it perfect.
- Analyze the cleaned data to find more insights.
- Write a detailed summary of the results.

## Tools I Used

- **Python Libraries**: pandas

## Future Plans

- Automate the data cleaning process.
- Add machine learning to predict trends from the data.
- Create a dashboard to show results in a better way.
