Project Title:
Student Performance Analysis

Description:
This project is designed to analyze student performance data. It processes and visualizes the grades and other details of students to provide insights into their academic performance. It aims to identify high-performing students, calculate average grades, and provide a summary of pass/fail status across different students.

Features:
Data Loading:
The project reads student performance data from a CSV file.
Data Analysis:
Displays the total number of students.
Computes and shows the average grade of all students.
Displays the status of students (pass/fail) based on their grades.
Identifying High-Performing Students:
Extracts students who have grades above 15 and saves them to a separate CSV file.
Exporting Results:
The final results (high-performing students, total students, and status distribution) are saved to a CSV file (result.csv).
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used for data processing and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For visualizations (e.g., bar charts for pass/fail distribution).
